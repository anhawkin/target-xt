        <h3>Snowdonia</h3>
        <img class="thumbnail" src="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2017/01/SNO5456-e1312e9924d6.jpg">
        <p>Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa in Welsh) is the highest mountain in Wales and England. However you recognise this famous landmark, it is well worth a visit. Standing tall over the village of Llanberis, Snowdon is a part of a close-knit family of jagged peaks and can offer views of Snowdonia, Anglesey, Pembrokeshire and Ireland. Choose from six different paths to conquer this 1085 metre giant: The Llanberis Path, PYG Track, Miners’ Track, Watkin Path, Rhyd-Ddu Path or the Snowdon Ranger Path.</p>

        <p>No matter how you want to enjoy the area, you can walk, cycle, swing in the trees and splash about here to your heart's content! In the winter you can even head into the mountains with our very own Fell Top Assessors on our winter skills courses running from December to April. With 12 of the largest lakes in England and 3,105 kilometres of rights of way, this is truly one of Britain's breathing spaces.</p>

        <h3>Loch Ness</h3>
        <img class="thumbnail" src="http://www.visitscotland.com/cms-images/destinations/loch-ness/urquhart-castle">
        <p>Nessie, the legendary monster, has made Loch Ness the most famous of all Scotland's lochs; at twenty three miles long it is the second largest lake in Britain by area. Its great depth, however, means it holds several times more water than its nearest rival, Loch Lomond. There are many shorter and beautiful woodland walks on either side of the loch. Further north, Glenurquhart is the gateway to the magnificent pinewood-clad Glen Affric - Scotland's most beautiful glen. This is a wonderful area of the Highlands for walkers, having the highest mountains north of the Great Glen but also some splendid lower level and forest walks.</p>
